<h3 id="love">Love me tender</h3>
Love me tender Love me sweet Never let me go<br>
You have made my life complete<br>
And I love you so<br>
Love me tender Love me true<br>
All my dreams fulfill<br>
for my darling I love you<br>
And I always will<br>
<h3 id="cant">Can't help falling in love</h3>
Wise men say,<br>
only fools rush in<br>
But I can't help,<br>
falling in love with you<br>
Shall I stay?<br>
Would it be a sin?<br>
If I, I can't help,<br>
falling in love with you<br>
<h3 id="dont">Don't Be Cruel</h3>
You know I can be found,<br>
sitting home all alone,<br>
If you can't come around,<br>
at least please telephone.<br>
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.<br>
